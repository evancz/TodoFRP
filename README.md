# TodoFRP

This program is split into three distinct parts: Model, Update, and Display.
The Todo file puts all of that together.

* [Model.elm](https://github.com/evancz/TodoFRP/blob/master/Model.elm):
  Representation of the todo list application.

* [Update.elm](https://github.com/evancz/TodoFRP/blob/master/Update.elm):
  Describes how to update the todo list based on user's actions.

* [Display.elm](https://github.com/evancz/TodoFRP/blob/master/Display.elm):
  How to display our model on screen. Also describes interactive UI
  elements and makes them available for updating the model.

* [Todo.elm](https://github.com/evancz/TodoFRP/blob/master/Todo.elm):
  Bring together the model, update, and display to create the todo list.
